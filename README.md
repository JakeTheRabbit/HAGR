# HAGR: Home Assistant Grow Room

Welcome to the Home Assistant Grow Room (HAGR) repository. This project focuses on automating grow rooms using Home Assistant. Note that some features may not work as expected and instructions are minimal. Familiarity with Home Assistant is recommended. This is a slow burner work in progress, lots of stuff hasn't been published yet purely due to lack of time. I'm currently setting up a licensed medical facility which which is taking 120% of my time. 

Here is an exmaple of my fertigation control dashboard.

## AI Envornment Alerts for Home Assistant

### ðŸŒ± Advanced Environmental Monitoring
- **7 Sensor Types**: Temperature, Humidity, COâ‚‚, VPD, Leaf VPD, VWC (Volumetric Water Content), pwEC (Pore Water Electrical Conductivity).
- **Day/Night Awareness**: Different thresholds for lights-on / lights-off periods.
- **Trend Analysis**: Calculates sensor trends (RAPID_RISE, STABLE, etc.) to inform alert severity.
- **Centralized Entity Configuration**: All Home Assistant entities easily defined in `grow_monitor.py`.

### ðŸ§  AI-Powered Intelligence
- **OpenAI Integration**: Provides concise AI-generated summaries of current environmental issues in notifications (describes *what* is wrong, not how to fix it).
- **Periodic AI Trend Analysis**: A framework for future enhancements to analyze overall trends (currently logs a placeholder).

### ðŸš¨ Intelligent Alert System
- **Smart Summary Notifications**: Consolidates multiple active alerts into a single notification. Notifications use a consistent tag to replace previous ones.
- **Configurable Severity Levels**: IGNORE, NORMAL, URGENT, CRITICAL, based on violation duration and trend.
- **Intelligent Rate Limiting**:
    - Base 1-hour cooldown between summary notifications.
    - Extends to a 6-hour quiet period after any sensor alert is acknowledged (muted) via a notification action.
    - New *critical* alerts bypass cooldowns for immediate notification.
- **Actionable Notifications**:
    - Buttons to mute specific alerting sensors for 1 hour or 6 hours.
    - Button to activate a global "Pause ALL Alerts" `input_boolean`.
- **Per-Sensor Muting:** Temporarily silence alerts for specific sensors if an issue is known or non-critical.
- **Persistent State**: Remembers user-muted sensors and notification cooldown states across AppDaemon restarts (via a `.pkl` data file).

## Features

The integrated features include but are not limited to:

- **[CO2 Control](blueprints/co2_control_and_alerts.yaml):** Setpoints for day/night, high / low alerting, safety off (turns off the relay if left on for more than x minutes), hysteresis, auto-dim lights on low CO2 (if your CO2 levels drop below your set point for too long the lights dim to prevent damage).
- [Teros-12 SDI-12 to ESP32](https://github.com/JakeTheRabbit/HAGR/blob/main/teros-12/Readme.md): Integrate VWC (moisture) and substrate EC readings into Home Assistant. Connect your Teros 12 or make a cheap chinese version and connect to Home Assistant with an ESP32
- **Thermal Camera**: Live leaf temperature readings using ESP32 and MLX90641.
- **VPD Calculations**: Live leaf and environment calculations to maintain optimal humidity and temperature.
- **Automatic VPD Control**: Adjusts the relative humidity to maintain a static leaf VPD despite temperature and humidity fluctuations. Can control the dehumidifier/humidifier to achieve this. 
- [**Nutrient Dosing**](https://github.com/JakeTheRabbit/HAGR/blob/main/automated_batch_tank.md): Automated dosing with peristaltic pumps using Athena Pro line nutrients.
- **Lighting Control**: LED lights and drivers controlled via PWM as dimmable entities in Home Assistant. Automatic light acclimation (i.e. increase ppfd by 5% every day until 1200umol).
- **Tank Level Monitoring**: Ultrasonic distance sensor for tank levels, alters for empty batch tank, status monitor % full.
- **Notifications**: Hourly sensor updates and alerts for high/low setpoints (e.g., Temperature, VWC, CO2). Urgent/Alarm alerts for critical stuff like low CO2, high temperature (breaks through DND).
- **Fan Speed Control**: Automatically adjusts fan speed to maintain a temperature.
- **AC Control**: Control your wall mounted AC unit with an IR blaster. PID control a room to +/- 0.2 celcius with a regular AC. 
- **Irrigation Strategy & Crop Steering**:
  - Multiple sensor triggers for redundancy
  - Dosing calculations and adjustments
  - Emergency shots and dryback percentage calculations
  - Various transitions and fail-safes
- **Lighting Automation**: Automatic lights on/off.
- **Temperature Control**: Day/night setpoints.
