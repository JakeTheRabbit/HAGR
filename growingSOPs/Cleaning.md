Growing cannabis is 10% growing and 90% cleaning.

## Hand Washing

- Extremely important to wash hands regularlyy to prevent cross contamination of bacteria, viruses, algea, mould, chemicals and other nasties we don't want on ourselves, our equipment and our plants.

- Video showing how quickly bacteria can spread - imagine this is algea on rockwool cubes!

## Wearing Gloves

- We wear gloves for two reasons: 
1. To project ourselves from harmful chemicals
2. Project the plants from us, carriers of bacteria, mould and algea

***There is no point wearing gloves if we don't wash our hands thoroughly first.***

## The Microscopic World of Cross-Contamination

Understanding cross-contamination in a medical cannabis grow facility requires appreciating the microscopic scale at which bacteria and other microorganisms operate. 

### How Much is Needed?

It's crucial to understand that it takes an incredibly small amount of bacteria, fungi, or viruses to start a contamination event:

- A single bacterium can multiply to over 8 million cells in just 24 hours under ideal conditions.
- Some plant pathogens, like those causing powdery mildew, can spread from a single spore.
- Viruses can infect a plant with as few as 10-100 particles.

This means that contamination can occur from amounts invisible to the naked eye.

### Scenario: A Day in the Life of Contamination

Let's walk through a scenario to illustrate how easily cross-contamination can occur:

1. **Morning Inspection**: 
   - A grower enters the veg room after checking their phone. Unknown to them, their phone harbors bacteria from their morning commute.
   - They adjust a plant with their bare hands, transferring some of these bacteria.

2. **Nutrient Application**:
   - The grower mixes nutrients for the plants. A tiny splash on their gloves goes unnoticed.
   - They move to the flowering room, still wearing the same gloves.
   - While adjusting plants, the nutrient residue on their gloves contacts several plants, potentially causing chemical burn.

3. **Pest Check**:
   - In the flowering room, they spot signs of spider mites on a plant.
   - They quickly check nearby plants with the same gloves, unknowingly spreading mites to previously uninfected plants.

4. **Lunch Break**:
   - The grower checks their phone again before lunch, transferring microbes from the grow room to their device.
   - After lunch, they return to work, bringing new bacteria from their lunch and phone back into the grow room.

5. **End of Day**:
   - By day's end, what started as a few bacteria on a phone has potentially spread throughout the facility, compromising plant health and product quality.

This scenario demonstrates how easily contaminants can spread through a facility due to seemingly minor oversights in hygiene protocols.

## The Cellphone Conundrum

Cellphones are ubiquitous in modern life, but they pose a significant risk in sterile environments like medical cannabis grows.

### Why Cellphones are Problematic:

1. **Bacterial Reservoirs**: Studies have shown that the average cellphone carries more bacteria than a toilet seat. In a grow room, this means introducing a host of potential contaminants.

2. **Frequent Use**: We check our phones dozens of times a day, making them a constant source of hand-to-surface-to-hand transfer.

3. **Difficult to Clean**: The intricate design of phones, with their many crevices, makes them challenging to sanitize thoroughly.

### Best Practices for Cellphone Use in Grow Facilities:

1. **No-Phone Zones**: Designate certain areas, especially those with exposed plants, as no-phone zones.

2. **Sanitization Stations**: Provide UV sanitization boxes or alcohol wipes at entry points for cleaning phones before entering sensitive areas.

3. **Protective Covers**: Use disposable, sterile covers for phones that must be used in grow areas.

4. **Hand Hygiene**: Always wash hands after using a phone and before interacting with plants.

5. **Education**: Train staff on the risks associated with cellphone use in sterile environments.

## Conclusion

Cross-contamination in a medical cannabis grow facility can occur from the smallest oversight. A single bacterium, spore, or virus particle can quickly multiply and spread, potentially compromising entire crops. By understanding the microscopic nature of these threats and implementing strict hygiene protocols - including addressing often-overlooked sources like cellphones - growers can significantly reduce the risk of contamination and ensure the production of high-quality, safe medical cannabis.


## Case Study: The Contaminated Stock Tank

### Scenario: Nutrient Mixing Gone Wrong

Let's follow a hypothetical situation in a medical cannabis grow facility:

#### Day 1: The Mixing Process

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - John, an experienced grower, prepares to mix a fresh batch of nutrient solution for the flowering room.
   - He sets up his mixing station with various salt nutrients, a large mixing container, and stirring equipment.

2. **The Oversight**:
   - John washes his hands but forgets to sanitize the scoop he uses to measure salts.
   - Unknown to him, the scoop has traces of organic matter from a previous use.

3. **The Mixing**:
   - As John measures and adds different salts to the water, he introduces a small amount of contamination from the scoop.
   - The warm water in the mixing container provides an ideal environment for any bacteria present.

4. **Transfer to Stock Tank**:
   - After thoroughly mixing, John transfers the solution to a 500-gallon stock tank.
   - He doesn't notice any immediate issues and considers the job well done.

#### Days 2-4: The Unseen Growth

- The stock tank, kept at room temperature in the nutrient room, becomes an ideal breeding ground for the introduced bacteria.
- The nutrient-rich solution provides ample food for bacterial proliferation.
- No visible signs appear yet, but the bacterial population is doubling every few hours.

#### Day 5: First Signs

- John notices a slight cloudiness in the stock tank but attributes it to undissolved salts.
- He stirs the solution and continues to use it for fertigation, unknowingly spreading the contamination to plants.

#### Day 7: Visible Problem

1. **The Discovery**:
   - Upon entering the nutrient room, John is hit with an unusual odor.
   - Inspecting the stock tank, he sees visible slime and cloudy patches floating in the solution.

2. **The Realization**:
   - John now understands that the tank is severely contaminated with bacteria.
   - He immediately stops using the solution and begins to investigate the cause.

### The Consequences

1. **Crop Impact**:
   - Plants that received the contaminated solution show signs of stress and potential root problems.
   - There's a risk of pythium or other water-borne pathogens affecting the crop.

2. **Financial Loss**:
   - The entire 500-gallon nutrient solution must be disposed of safely.
   - Time and resources are wasted in cleaning and sanitizing the entire irrigation system.
   - Potential loss of affected plants or reduced yield quality.

3. **Operational Disruption**:
   - Fertigation schedules are disrupted while the system is cleaned.
   - Additional labor is required for thorough sanitization of all equipment.

### Root Cause Analysis

Upon investigation, it was determined that:
- The unsanitized scoop introduced a small amount of organic matter containing bacteria.
- The nutrient-rich, warm environment of the stock tank provided ideal conditions for bacterial growth.
- Lack of regular sanitization of mixing equipment contributed to the issue.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Equipment Sanitation**: All tools, including measuring scoops, must be thoroughly sanitized before each use.
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Implement daily checks of stock tanks for any signs of contamination.
3. **Temperature Control**: Consider cooling systems for large stock tanks to inhibit bacterial growth.
4. **Hygiene Protocols**: Reinforce the importance of strict adherence to hygiene protocols, even for routine tasks.
5. **Training**: Conduct regular training sessions on contamination risks and prevention methods.

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how a minor oversight in hygiene practices during nutrient mixing can escalate into a significant contamination event. In a medical cannabis facility, where product purity is paramount, such incidents can have far-reaching consequences. It underscores the critical importance of maintaining rigorous sanitation practices at every step of the cultivation process, from the smallest tasks to facility-wide operations.
