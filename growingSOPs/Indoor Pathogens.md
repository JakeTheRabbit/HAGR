# Indoor Cannabis Pathogen Fact Sheet: Fusarium, Pythium, and Botrytis

## Overview Table

| Pathogen | Type | Prevalence | Primary Infection Site | Main Symptoms |
|----------|------|------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Fusarium | Fungus | Moderate | Roots, stem base | Wilting, yellowing, stem rot |
| Pythium | Oomycete | High | Roots | Root rot, damping-off |
| Botrytis | Fungus | High | Buds, leaves | Gray mold, bud rot |

## Detailed Information

### 1. Fusarium

**Description:** Soil-borne fungal pathogen causing vascular wilt and root rot.

**Prevalence:** Moderate in indoor grows, more common in reused soil or hydroponic systems.

**Symptoms:**
- Wilting despite adequate water
- Yellowing of lower leaves
- Brown discoloration in stem vascular tissue
- Stunted growth

**Favorable Conditions:**
- High soil moisture
- Temperatures between 20-30°C (68-86°F)
- Poor drainage

**Impact on Yield:** Can reduce yield by 20-50% if left untreated.

**Common Scenario:** Introducing contaminated soil or using unsterilized equipment.

**Prevention:**
- Use sterile growing media
- Maintain proper pH (5.8-6.2)
- Avoid overwatering
- Sterilize all equipment

**Treatment:**
- Remove and destroy infected plants
- Apply beneficial microbes (Trichoderma spp., Bacillus subtilis)
- Improve drainage and reduce watering

### 2. Pythium

**Description:** Water mold causing root rot and damping-off in seedlings.

**Prevalence:** High, especially in hydroponic systems and overwatered soil.

**Symptoms:**
- Brown, mushy roots
- Stunted growth
- Wilting
- Damping-off in seedlings

**Favorable Conditions:**
- Overwatering
- Poor drainage
- High humidity
- Temperatures above 20°C (68°F)

**Impact on Yield:** Can cause total crop failure in severe cases, typically 30-60% yield loss.

**Common Scenario:** Overwatering combined with poor drainage and high humidity.

**Prevention:**
- Maintain proper water-to-air ratio in root zone
- Use beneficial microbes as a preventative measure
- Ensure good drainage and air circulation

**Treatment:**
- Improve drainage immediately
- Apply hydrogen peroxide solution (3%) to roots
- Introduce beneficial microbes (Bacillus spp., Trichoderma spp.)

### 3. Botrytis (Gray Mold)

**Description:** Fungal pathogen causing bud rot and gray mold on leaves and stems.

**Prevalence:** High, especially during flowering stage in humid conditions.

**Symptoms:**
- Gray, fuzzy mold on buds and leaves
- Brown, rotting buds
- Wet, slimy appearance on affected areas

**Favorable Conditions:**
- High humidity (above 60%)
- Poor air circulation
- Temperatures between 15-25°C (59-77°F)

**Impact on Yield:** Can destroy 20-80% of a crop, often affecting the most valuable parts (buds).

**Common Scenario:** Dense canopy combined with high humidity during late flowering stage.

**Prevention:**
- Maintain humidity below 50% during flowering
- Ensure good air circulation
- Prune to improve airflow
- Avoid water on buds and leaves

**Treatment:**
- Remove all infected plant material immediately
- Reduce humidity and increase air circulation
- Apply organic treatments (e.g., potassium bicarbonate, Bacillus subtilis)

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Fusarium | Pythium | Botrytis |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Primary Target | Vascular system | Root system | Aerial parts (buds, leaves) |
| Moisture Preference | Moist soil | Very wet conditions | High air humidity |
| Stage of Concern | All stages | Early growth and roots | Late flowering |
| Spread Method | Soil, water, equipment | Water, infected roots | Air, physical contact |

## Best Practices for Pathogen-Free Growing

1. Maintain proper environmental controls (temperature, humidity, airflow)
2. Use sterile growing media and clean equipment
3. Implement a robust Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program
4. Regularly inspect plants, especially roots and dense canopy areas
5. Optimize plant spacing and prune for good air circulation
6. Keep grow room clean and free of plant debris
7. Quarantine new plants before introducing them to the grow space
8. Use beneficial microbes as a preventative measure
9. Maintain detailed records of environmental conditions and plant health

**Note:** Always adhere to local regulations regarding cannabis cultivation and the use of any treatments or pesticides. Consult with experienced growers or agricultural experts for advice tailored to your specific situation.


- Fusarium
Fusarium is a fungal pathogen that causes wilting, root rot, and crown rot in various crops. It's particularly problematic in cereals, vegetables, and ornamental plants in NZ. Fusarium can survive in soil for long periods and is often spread through infected plant material or contaminated equipment.
- Pythium
Pythium is a genus of water molds that causes damping-off, root rot, and seed rot in various plants. It's particularly problematic in nurseries and greenhouses in NZ, affecting seedlings and young plants. Pythium thrives in wet conditions and can spread rapidly through water and contaminated soil.
- Botrytis

- Rhizoctonia
This fungal pathogen causes damping-off in seedlings and root rot in mature plants. It affects a broad range of crops in NZ, including potatoes, cereals, and vegetables. Rhizoctonia can survive in soil as sclerotia, making it challenging to eradicate once established.
Risk of exposure:
The risk is moderate to high if proper sanitation and prevention measures aren't followed. These pathogens can cause root rot, damping-off, and wilting, potentially leading to significant crop loss.

How it could happen (example sequence):
a) A grower introduces contaminated soil or uses unsterilized tools.
b) The pathogen spreads in the growing medium, especially if overwatering occurs.
c) Cannabis roots become infected, showing signs of browning or rotting.
d) Plants start wilting, yellowing, or showing stunted growth.
e) The infection spreads to other plants through water splashing or contaminated equipment.

Treatment steps:
a) Isolate affected plants immediately.
b) Remove and dispose of severely infected plants.
c) Reduce watering frequency and improve drainage for remaining plants.
d) Apply a suitable fungicide (e.g., phosphorous acid for Pythium, copper-based for Fusarium).
e) Improve air circulation around plants.
f) Sterilize all growing equipment and surfaces with a hydrogen peroxide solution.
g) Consider beneficial microbes like Trichoderma to suppress pathogens.
h) Monitor closely and repeat treatments if necessary.

Prevention:

Use sterile growing media and tools.
Maintain proper watering practices (avoid overwatering).
Ensure good drainage and air circulation.
Regularly inspect plants for early signs of infection.
Implement a rigorous sanitation protocol.


**Fusarium:**


**Pythium:**


**Rhizoctonia:**


**Phytophthora:**
This genus of water molds is a significant threat to many plant species in NZ. It causes root rot and collar rot in a wide range of plants, including avocados, kiwifruit, and native kauri trees. Phytophthora spreads through water and infected soil, making it difficult to control once established.

**Verticillium:**
This soil-borne fungal pathogen causes vascular wilt in a wide range of plants, including vegetables, ornamentals, and trees. It's a significant issue for many crops in NZ, particularly potatoes and tomatoes. Verticillium can persist in soil for years, making crop rotation an essential management strategy.

Plant pathogens infecting marijuana (Cannabis sativa L.) plants reduce growth of the crop by affecting the roots, crown, and foliage. In addition, fungi (molds) that colonize the inflorescences (buds) during development or after harvest, and which colonize internal tissues as endophytes, can reduce product quality. The pathogens and molds that affect C. sativa grown hydroponically indoors (in environmentally controlled growth rooms and greenhouses) and field-grown plants were studied over multiple years of sampling. A PCR-based assay using primers for the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA confirmed identity of the cultures. Root-infecting pathogens included Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Fusarium brachygibbosum, Pythium dissotocum, Pythium myriotylum, and Pythium aphanidermatum, which caused root browning, discoloration of the crown and pith tissues, stunting and yellowing of plants, and in some instances, plant death.
