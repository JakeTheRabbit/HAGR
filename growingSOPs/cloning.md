## 1. Introduction

Cloning is a fundamental technique in cannabis cultivation, enabling growers to replicate their best-performing plants. This guide provides a step-by-step process for successful cloning, referencing Athena Pro Line nutrients with an Electrical Conductivity (EC) baseline of 3.0 millisiemens per centimeter (mS/cm). Adjust EC levels accordingly if using other nutrient brands (e.g., Canna Baseline is around 2.0 mS/cm; 50% strength would be 1.0 mS/cm).

> **Why Cloning Matters:** Cloning ensures genetic consistency, allowing growers to preserve desirable traits such as potency, flavor, and growth characteristics. It also accelerates the cultivation process compared to growing from seed.

**Note:** The health and vigor of the mother plant directly impact cloning success. While cuttings can be taken from younger plants, using well-established, actively growing mother plants yields better results.

## 2. Mother Plant Care

Proper care of mother plants is crucial for producing healthy clones. Below are key parameters and best practices to maintain vigorous mother plants.

### 2.1 Key Parameters

- **Nutrient Solution EC:** Minimum of 1.5 mS/cm or higher, depending on light intensity.
- **Daily Irrigation:** Employ vegetative steering with 15–20% runoff at every fertigation. Frequency depends on pot size. Avoid significant dry backs.
- **Pruning and Topping:** Perform early and often to produce uniform cuttings.
- **Training:** Create an open canopy with numerous similar-sized nodes receiving equal light—aim for a large, flat-topped bush.
- **Mother Plant Cycle:** Replace mother plants every 3–4 months to prevent woody stems and accumulation of pathogens.
- **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Implement regular IPM protocols. Products like Osmoslay can help control mites, but ensure thorough coverage.

### 2.2 Best Practices for Mother Plants

| Category             | Item                                          | Done |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------|
| Nutrient Management  | A day before taking clones, flush mother plants with half-strength nutrient solution. This can make stems less rubbery and more resilient. | [ ] |
| Selection of Mother Plants | Choose clones that exhibit exceptional growth rate, root development, and overall vigor to serve as future mother plants. | [ ] |
| Genetic Integrity    | Be mindful of genetic drift over successive cloning generations. Regularly introducing plants from seed can help maintain genetic diversity. | [ ] |

> **Anecdote:** Think of cloning like making photocopies—each copy may introduce minor imperfections. Over time, these imperfections can accumulate, affecting plant quality.

> **Why Adjust Conditions?:** Gradually lowering humidity acclimates clones to ambient conditions, preparing them for transplant. Use an infrared temperature sensor to measure the leaf temperature as they are close to the propagation light. 

### 5.3 Daily Maintenance Routine

> **Important:** Maintain hygeine throughout like a baby in an incubator. Spray the humidity domes with hydrogen peroxide when you wipe them out daily during days 5-14. Don't touch the cubes with your skin always wear clean gloves, otherwise you will unknowngly transfer green algea spores and the cube will go green. Wipe off the hydrogen peroxide before placing the tray back on top of the clones. Do not allow standing water in the trays, as this can hinder root development and promote disease.

1. **Humidity Management:**
   - **Days 2–4:** Keep the dome closed to maintain high humidity.
   - **Days 5–9:** "Burp" the dome daily by opening it for 5–20 minutes to exchange air.
   - **Days 10–14:** Gradually increase ventilation to lower humidity.
2. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:**
   - Check readings at least twice daily.
   - Adjust environmental controls to maintain optimal conditions.
3. **Irrigation Management:**
   - **Weigh Trays Daily:** Compare to initial weight to determine moisture loss.
   - **Irrigate When Needed:**
     - Water when trays have lost 40–50% of their initial water weight.
     - Use nutrient solution with an EC of 1.5–2.0 mS/cm and pH of 5.5–6.0.
     - Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.
4. **Feeding Schedule:**
   - **Days 5, 7, 9, 11:** Provide nutrient solution as per irrigation needs.
   - **Maintain Dry Back:** Allow a 30–35% reduction in moisture between feedings.
5. **Hardening Off:**
   - **Days 10–14:** Slowly reduce humidity to match ambient room levels.
   - Open dome vents incrementally each day.
6. **Monitoring Root Development:**
   - Gently lift a few cuttings to check for root emergence.
   - Roots should appear between Days 7–14.

### 5.4 Pro Tips

- **Cleanliness Is Key:** Always wear gloves and sanitize tools to prevent contamination.
- **Monitor for Pests and Disease:** Early detection is crucial for effective management.
- **Adjust for Environment:** In cooler settings, you may need to burp the domes more frequently due to condensation.
- **Avoid Overcrowding:** Ensure adequate spacing for airflow, reducing the risk of mold.
- **Record Keeping:** Maintain detailed logs of environmental conditions and interventions.

> **Anecdote:** Think of taking clones like surgery. Imagine you are operating on a baby. Take the same level of care, and hygeine a surgeon would.
