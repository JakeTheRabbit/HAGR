I usually try and connect all my IoT devices through ESP Home to work with Home Assistant however the Arduino libraries for all the m5stack esp32 devices are far more comprehensive than the Esphome. Thankfully we have MQTT. 

This whole thing was made using Chat GPT/Claude I don't really have a working understanding so don't ask me for help. 

How to setup (this assumes you have basic knowledge of using Arduino IDE (ask Chat GPT for help its really good at it): 

1. Download Arduino IDE
2. Download https://github.com/HarveyBates/ESP32-SDI12 and install the library through zip in the arduino IDE. This enables SDI-12 communication directly with the ESP32.
3. Get an m5 stack grove cable and connect the cables see below image for what I did.
4. Get your ESP32 (I have tested with M5 Atom, M5 Atom S3, M5 PoEESP32 and M5 Dial).
5. Connect the Teros 12 to the ESP32 and plug into your computer
7. Copy the .ino file into the Arduino IDE and flash the ESP32. Change the #define SDI12_DATA_PIN 26 to whatever pin the yellow grove cable is connected to on your esp32.
8. Any errors paste into chat gpt or claude for trouble shooting
9. Profit?


If you have a Teros-12 Solus with the 3.5mm jack this is the pinout:

If you want to use the Chinese Teros-12 rip off that also works with this code for about 1/3 the price. https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/China-low-price-CE-IP68-SID12_1600643601689.html

Wiring for connecting the Chinese Teros to the Grove cable:

Bit of shrink wrap and thats it...

Assumming you have mqtt setup in Home Assistant add this to your configuration.yaml file. 

```

      state_topic: "sdi12/mtec-w2"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.vwc }}"

Arduino sketch: (Updated 03/007 with an attempt at callibrating the EC to the Teros 12 Solus Bluetooth dongle which I am using as benchmark).

Did a bit of really scientific testing using the previous arduino code.

|                        | Teros 12 ESP32 (using this arduino code and esp32) | 50.59 | 2.44 |

Hmmmm definitely not getting the kind of readings we want so went and looked at the manual...

I have used the Teros12 manual pages 15 16 17 https://www.labcell.com/media/140632/teros12%20manual.pdf

Now getting these outputs calculated on board the esp32 (these could also be calculated in Home Assistant using templates for easier tweaking). 

Added a webserver and OTA so you can view the readings live with a timestamp at the ESP32 device IP address on your network:
